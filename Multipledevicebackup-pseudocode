Begin
    Initialize logging system
    Set log file with rotation and format settings

    Prompt for network device password

    Define list of devices with their properties:
        - Device type
        - Host IP
        - Username
        - Use the provided password for all

    Define backup_config function for a single device:
        Try
            Establish connection to the device using credentials
            Disable pagination to capture full configuration
            Retrieve the current running configuration
            Enable pagination back to normal
            Generate a filename using the device's IP and the current timestamp
            Save the configuration to the file
            Log success message indicating the backup was saved
        Catch any exceptions during the process:
            Log the error with device information

    Define backup_all_configs function to handle multiple devices:
        Record start time
        Use ThreadPoolExecutor to manage parallel execution:
            Map backup_config function across all devices
        Calculate total time taken for the backup process
        Log the total time
        Return backup results and the total time

    Main execution block:
        Call backup_all_configs function
        Print backup results and total time

End




Function get_password
    Prompt user for the password applicable to all devices
    Return password

Function backup_config(device)
    Establish connection to the device using credentials
    Enter privileged mode
    Disable terminal pagination
    Fetch the running configuration
    Re-enable terminal pagination
    Generate a timestamped filename for backup
    Write the configuration to a file
    Log the backup success
    Return backup status message

Function backup_all_configs
    Record start time
    Use a ThreadPoolExecutor to perform backup_config in parallel across all devices
    Calculate total time taken for the backup process
    Log the total time taken
    Return results and total time

Function main
    Get password from user and set it for all devices
    Call backup_all_configs
    Print results and the total time taken for backups

If script is executed as the main module
    Call main function
