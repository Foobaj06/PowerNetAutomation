        Configure log file with rotation properties

    Define network device configuration:
        Device type, host IP, username, and prompt for password

    Set monitoring interval and define interface ranges

    Connect to network device using netmiko

Function setup_logger
    Initialize logger 'NetworkStatusLogger' with INFO level
    Create a rotating log file 'interface_status.log' with a maximum size and backup count
    Set log format to include timestamp, severity, and message
    Attach handler to logger
    Return logger

Function notify_admin
    Input: logger, message
    Display message
    Log message as a warning using logger

Function monitor_interfaces
    Input: connection, interface ranges, logger
    For each range in interface ranges
        Send command to fetch status for the range
        Split the output into lines
        For each line from the third line onwards
            Extract interface name and status
            Log the interface status
            If the status is 'down'
                Call notify_admin to log and alert about the down status

Function main
    Set up logger
    Define device details (type, host, username, password)
    Define interface ranges to monitor
    Connect to the device using credentials
    Repeat indefinitely at 60-second intervals
        Monitor interfaces
        Handle timeouts and log them
        Handle other exceptions and log them
    Disconnect after monitoring (implicit in with block)

If script is run directly
    Call main function
